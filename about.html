            <p>
                This is a weather forecasting application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather data, 
                as well as an application that uses the OpenRouteService API to fetch and display direction and route data. 
                This was created by Nick Bennings who is a student studying Computer Science at UCCS.
